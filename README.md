# Two-Way Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview
This Two-Way Movie Recommender System versatile tool designed to cater to a wide range of movie enthusiasts. It operates in two distinct modes to accommodate different viewing preferences: providing recommendations for popular genre films and uncovering lesser-known, high-quality movies.

## Features
1. Popular Genre Recommendations: Offers a list of top 10 movies in a selected genre, focusing on the most popular and highly rated films. Ideal for viewers who prefer trending and mainstream content.

2. Hidden Gems Discovery: Suggests three movies similar to a user-selected title, prioritizing high-quality but less popular films. Perfect for those seeking to explore underrated or niche content.
   Hidden Gems Discovery taps into the long tail of movie distribution. While mainstream movies garner a significant portion of attention and votes, there exists a vast array of quality movies that, despite their high ratings, have not achieved the same level of popularity or visibility. Our system aims to shine a light on these movies, offering users a chance to explore high-quality content that lies off the beaten path.
