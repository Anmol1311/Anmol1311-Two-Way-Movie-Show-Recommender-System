# Two-Way Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview
This project develops a Two-Way Movie Recommender System that leverages a dual approach to cater to diverse viewer preferences. The system not only highlights popular movies in various genres but also uncovers lesser-known, quality movies/shows, tapping into the "long tail" of movie distribution.

## Objectives
- Trend-Based Recommendations: To offer a list of the top 10 most popular and highly rated movies/shows in a selected genre, catering to viewers who prefer mainstream, trending content.
- Hidden Gems Discovery: To utilize the long tail concept to recommend three movies similar to a user-selected title. These recommendations focus on high-quality films that have not amassed a large number of votes, aiming to introduce users to underrated or niche content.
